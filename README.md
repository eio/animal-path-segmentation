# Usage

	py run_model.py

Training the model consists of:
- showing it examples,
- letting it make guesses,
- and telling it when itâ€™s wrong.

The trained model will also be tested on a validation dataset.

# Outputs

All functions that save or load files can be found in `save_and_load.py`

- During training, a saved `model+optimizer.pth` file will be updated on each completed training epoch and saved inside of `results/`
- Predictions for each epoch are stored in `predictions/`
- The final train/test loss plot for all epochs is stored in `figures/`
